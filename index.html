                    <p>
                        My passion for building things began in 7th grade during a group project where we designed and made t-shirts. 
                        That experience sparked a drive thatâ€™s stayed with me ever since. I started working at 14, earlier than most 
                        of my friends. Throughout high school, I explored different roles and even balanced two jobs while managing 
                        school â€” which taught me time management, responsibility, and adaptability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Iâ€™ve always known I wanted to pursue tech, but it wasnâ€™t until my senior year, during a web design course, 
                        that everything clicked. That experience opened my eyes to the creative and problem-solving side of technology, 
                        and Iâ€™ve been hooked ever since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Iâ€™m passionate about collaborating with others to create meaningful solutions. Whether coding, debugging, or 
                        brainstorming ideas with a team, Iâ€™m excited by the challenge and opportunity to learn. I thrive in environments 
                        that push me to think critically and help me grow as a developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Iâ€™m excited about the endless possibilities in tech and the chance to continue learning, creating, and evolving in this field.

            <p>I grew up playing games with family and friends, starting on the PlayStation 2 with titles like Guitar Hero, Ratchet & Clank, and Sly Cooper. Later, I got my own Xbox, where my passion for gaming really took off. I especially enjoy FPS, horror, and co-op puzzle games. These days, I mostly game on PC!
                <br>Here are some of my favorite games:
